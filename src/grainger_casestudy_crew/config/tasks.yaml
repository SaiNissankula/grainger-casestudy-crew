    Use a search tool to research about why a company like Grainger would bring hosting CAD files on their store in-house instead of using a another firm.
    The goal is to prepare enough information to write the following case study requirements:

    To help customers buy with confidence Grainger offers a wealth of product information on Grainger.com. This information includes visual assets such as images, videos & computer aided designs (CAD). Visual assets such as CAD are important for confident product selection because they provide detailed and accurate representations of products, allowing customers to visualize them more effectively. With CAD, customers can view products from various angles, explore different features, and assess dimensions with precision. This helps them make informed decisions about the suitability of a product for their needs, leading to greater confidence in their selections. Visual assets also play a key role in generating SEO for a page when used appropriately. Historically Grainger has partnered with an external vendor to create, manage & host these CAD assets on Grainger.com. Grainger now wants to bring the process of creating, managing & publishing the CAD assets inhouse. This will unlock the potential to create additional image assets for Grainger’s product assortment. Grainger already has a custom built software to manage image & video type of assets which would likely need to be extended to manage CAD assets.
